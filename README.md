# COVID-19-Vaccine-Tracker-Dashboard

## OBJECTIVE
The objective of the COVID-19 Global Vaccine Tracker dashboard is to provide real-time insights into the progress of COVID-19 vaccination efforts worldwide. It aims to track key vaccination metrics and analyze their impact on different regions and countries, thereby facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation.

## KPIs Explanation:
1. Number of People Partly Vaccinated: This KPI indicates the total number of individuals who have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine but have not completed the full vaccination regimen.
2. Number of People Fully Vaccinated: This KPI represents the total number of individuals who have received all recommended doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and are considered fully vaccinated.
3. People Not Vaccinated Over Population: This KPI calculates the percentage of the population that remains unvaccinated, providing insights into vaccination coverage and potential areas of concern.
4. Vaccinated vs Fully Vaccinated per Location: This KPI compares the number of people partly vaccinated with those fully vaccinated in each location, highlighting disparities in vaccination progress across different regions.
5. Vaccinated Over GDP: This KPI examines the relationship between the number of vaccinated individuals and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of each country, exploring how economic factors may influence vaccination rates.
6. People Vaccinated per Hundred by Location: This KPI standardizes vaccination data by expressing the number of vaccinated individuals per hundred people in each location, enabling comparisons between regions with varying population sizes.

## Outcome
The COVID-19 Global Vaccine Tracker dashboard provides stakeholders with timely and actionable insights into the progress and challenges of COVID-19 vaccination efforts worldwide. By facilitating data-driven decision-making, the dashboard contributes to the optimization of vaccination strategies, ultimately helping to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and save lives.
